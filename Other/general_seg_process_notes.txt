=================== SEGMENTATION PROCESS =================

- K-nn for segmenting brain from background (including skull)

- Opening (corrosion + dilation) for establishing mask

- Multiply mask with original picture to establish clear brain distinction

- K-nn for segmenting different tissue types
	(idea --> combine K-nn's with different feature sets)
	(idea --> create K-nn learning curve to compare errors for
		  finding optimal k)

=================== FEATURES ================== 

- T1 intensity
- T2 intensity
- T1 Gaussian
- T2 Gaussian
- T1 Median
- T2 Median
- T1-T2 difference
- Distance to center
